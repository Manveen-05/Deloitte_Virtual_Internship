# Deloitte_Virtual_Internship

This repository contains my submission for the Deloitte STEM Virtual Program. In this program, students are asked to help Daikibo Industrials (a global leader in manufacturing of heavy machinery) with a variety of problems that they are facing.

Task 01 - Coding
Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file. The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

In which location did machines break the most?
What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

Through this project, I learned how to:
Use the Analytics tool Tableau
Clean and prepare nested JSON data
Analyze time-series breakdown events using filters and aggregations
Use Tableau to build responsive, drill-down dashboards

Task 02 - Proposal
As part of Task 2 in the Deloitte Technology Program, I created a development proposal for an internal dashboard aimed at helping Daikibo Industrials analyze machine breakdowns across four factories.It taught me how to translate a technical idea into a well-organized document that aligns with business goals and expectations.
